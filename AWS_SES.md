To set up Amazon SES for scholars.ng, follow these steps in the AWS Management Console. This will prepare your account to send emails from your application.

  1. Verify Your Identity
  AWS requires you to prove you own the domain or email address you'll be sending from.
   1. Open the SES Console: Search for "SES" in the AWS Console.
   2. Verified Identities: Click Verified identities in the left sidebar, then click Create identity.
   3. Identity Type: 
       * Domain (Recommended): Choose this for production. Enter scholars.ng. AWS will provide CNAME records that you must add to your DNS provider.
       * Email Address: Choose this for quick testing. AWS will send a verification link to that email.
   4. Verification Status: Wait until the status changes to Verified.

  2. Request Production Access (Sandbox Exit)
  New SES accounts are in a "Sandbox" by default. In the sandbox:
   * You can only send email to verified email addresses.
   * You are limited to 200 emails per 24-hour period.
   1. On the SES Dashboard, look for the Account dashboard tab.
   2. Click Request production access.
   3. Fill out the form:
       * Mail type: Marketing or Transactional (choose both if applicable).
       * Website URL: https://scholars.ng
       * Use Case Description: Briefly explain that you are sending welcome emails, newsletters, and system notifications to your users.
   4. AWS usually approves this within 24 hours.

  3. Create Credentials
  You need credentials to allow your Go backend to talk to SES. You have two main options:

  Option A: SMTP Credentials (Easiest for most libraries)
   1. Go to SMTP Settings in the SES console.
   2. Click Create SMTP credentials.
   3. This will create an IAM user. Click Create and then Download Credentials.
       * Note: These are different from your standard IAM secret keys.
   4. Note your SMTP Endpoint (e.g., email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com).

  Option B: IAM User (Best for AWS SDK)
  If you plan to use the aws-sdk-go-v2, it's better to create a dedicated IAM user:
   1. Go to the IAM Console -> Users -> Create user.
   2. Name it ses-sender.
   3. Attach policy: AmazonSESFullAccess (or a custom policy restricted to ses:SendRawEmail).
   4. Go to the Security credentials tab of the new user and click Create access key.
   5. Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

  4. Integration Strategy for backend/main.go
  Your current Go backend (backend/main.go) has the data models but no sending logic. Once you have the credentials, you will need to:
   1. Add dependencies: go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2 or an SMTP library like github.com/wneessen/go-mail.
   2. Environment Variables: Store your credentials securely (e.g., AWS_REGION, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).

  Would you like me to help you implement the sendCampaign function in your Go backend once you have these credentials ready?
